  <p>This game involves you (a mortal) trying to survive amongst a horde of strange creatures that
    are out to kill you, you may wonder why you but you are extremely hated. Not because you're mortal but because
     you know the secret of supernaturals and you’re willing to expose them. </p>

  <p> aren’t going to kill them but humans have been a massive threat to all supernatural life since the beginning of time,
    vampires are the most endangered therefore making them the most hostile to encounter.  </p> 
  
 <p> Little do you know your close group of friends appear to be supernaturals too, you cant believe it as these occurences
  all unfold at once; werewolfs, witches and vampires and mortals that are what are protecting you against the danger
  you will be brought into. </p> 
  
  <p> Will you dive deeper into this loophole to find out where all these creatures came from or will you play it safe? </p>
